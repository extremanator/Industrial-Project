Here we have a list of all the potential vulnerabilities for which we can create coding puzzles.

- Buffer Overflow
  - Due to lack of checking boundaries
  - Due to usage of horrible C functions, for example: `gets()`
- ~~SQL Injection~~
- Side Channel attacks
  - Having a login attempt fail faster when the password is wrong
- Faulty Protocolos
