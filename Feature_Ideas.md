## Final Goals
- When submitting a solution, make sure the feedback message is visible
- When submitting a solution, a spinner should appear (until feedback)
- In a Test:
  + If there was a compilation error, another try will be given.
    In any other case, we move on to the next question.
  + There is no feedback displayed while taking the test.
  + At the end of the test all questions with wrong solutions will be displayed.
  + Possibly add a "retake test" option at the end.
- Add new problems
- Write all the documentation (manuals + code)
- Prepare final presentation

  
#### Software Development
- Add problems list                                   (done)
- Add problems by subjects 
- Add "Take a Test" option                            (done)
- Add solved problems history                         (done)
- Add Problem page                                    (done)
- Add ability to search for users and see their stats (done)

## Estimated checkpoints
- 10 example problems with the ability to check correctness of solution - 12.5
- User profiles - 12.5
- Adding documentation, making code neater, fixing various small issues we'll surely have, and improving the UI (html/css) in preparation for mid review and submission + Create Powerpoint presentation for the mid-meeting - 19.5
\*At this point we'll have a framework for creating problems
- Adding adminstrative view of performance of all Users and more problems - 26.5
- 30-50 problems and a test option for the user - 2.6
- Tests for software - 9.6
- Fixing more issues, creation of all the documents described in SOW (architechure documentation, test documentation, manual for administrator and user, etc) - 16.6
- From this point adding various quality of life changes (making things cooler! like the real websites!) - 17.6+
